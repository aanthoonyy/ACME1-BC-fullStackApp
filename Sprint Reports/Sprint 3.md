## What's New (User Facing)
 * Updated design for contact form and service page
 * Went back and forth between the client on small design changes
 * We created individual service pages
 * We created a call to action banner on most pages
 * Navigation between pages was made easier


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We met with out client more frequently in Sprint 3 than we did during Sprint 2 because we wanted to make constant updates to the website. With this we were able to implement most of the features that our client requested.

## Unfinished Work
* We need to link the contact form to our client's email
* We need to incorporate Google Analytics next semester, along with some WCAG and GDPR compliance work.
* We also need to figure out a way to manage client information

## Completed Issues/User Stories for Sprint 3
* URL: [Add testimonials](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/21). We wanted to add a testimonial section to enhance user experience.
* URL: [ Add or enhance images and videos on website](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/22). We made sure our website was visually pleasing for potential clients.
* URL: [ Call to action on homepage ](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/19). We created call to action banners along with corresponding buttons to make navigation easier within the website.
* The following issues are about small design changes to certain pages.
* URL: [ Refine home page design, first iteration](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/15)
* URL:[ Refine about page design, first iteration](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/16)
* URL: [ Refine services page design, first iteration](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/17)

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint, we plan to fully incorporate these next semester
 * URL: [Manage client information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/9). We have not completed this issue, however, we will most likely use a third-party application to complete this issue. This issue is ready to begin.
 * URL: [Update website information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/8). We have not completed this, however, website changes and updates can be made through the Wix manager page. We are currently working on this though.
 * URL: [Tracking visitor behavior](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/6). We have not completed this, however, tracking visitor behavior can be done through Google Analytics. We plan to complete this in the spring.
 * URL: [Viewing performance reports](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/7). We have not completed this, however, like the previous issue, performance reports can be viewed through Google Analytics, which is compatible with Wix. We plan to complete this in the spring.

The reason we were unable to finish these issues is due to us focusing on design. Speaking to our mentor and professor, we were told to start working with website analytics in the Spring.

## Code Files for Review
None as of right now.
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to update designs on our website and make it look modern and up to our client's standards
  * Setting up the technical aspects of the whole project, so front-end and back-end components
  * We learned more about working with a client and a team in a real world setting
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * We would like to meet with our client more to continuously refine the features on the website.
   * We want a better understanding on some plugins that can be used for website development.
   * We want to improve website animation to make the user experience better.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Creating some sort of client portal or database through Wix so our client is able to keep track of her clients.
   * Performance analytics.
   * Continue refining features on our website.

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Created design prototypes and mockups using Adobe Illustrator
 * Gained feedback on our prototypes to begin with revisions
 * Gained access to the Wix website as collaborators
 * Created the home page and the contact form page


## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We met with our client to discuss website design. We were able to do this throughout sprint 2 and deliver prototypes, which we gained feedback on. We were also given a guide on our client's brand design as well. When we were given access to the Wix website as collaborators, we still continued to do research while we were implementing our features to make sure we met our client's requirements

## Unfinished Work
* We need to link the contact form to our client
* We have placeholders for a lot of what we have implemented so far, since we do not have the information that our client actually wants to include on their website. Our plan is to discuss this at our next meeting on 11/7/2024.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
* URL: [Create an accessible homepage on a mobile device](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/2). We were able to create a mobile view for the website, however, we will refine this when we get feedback from our client.
 * URL: [Accessing services information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/3). We completed this feature on the main homepage, however, we want to create an individual page for services.
 * URL: [Creating a contact form](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/4). We have completed this, and we want to further refine it to fit our client's needs.
 * URL: [Create initial design prototype](https://github.com/users/aanthoonyy/projects/4/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=86108288&issue=aanthoonyy%7CACME1-BC-fullStackApp%7C12). We have completed this, as it was essential to understand what our client wanted.
 * URL: [Get access to the Wix website as collaborators](https://github.com/users/aanthoonyy/projects/4/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=86108527&issue=aanthoonyy%7CACME1-BC-fullStackApp%7C13). We have completed this, and it helped us start working on the website.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 * URL: [Logging into the client portal](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/5). We have not completed this issue, Wix allows for third party applications that we can use to hopefully implement a client log in portal. We plan to begin this soon, when we get more information from our client.
 * URL: [Manage client information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/9). We have not completed this issue, however, we will most likely use a third-party application to complete this issue. This issue is ready to begin.
 * URL: [Update website information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/8). We have not completed this, however, website changes and updates can be made through the Wix manager page. We are currently working on this though.
 * URL: [Tracking visitor behavior](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/6). We have not completed this, however, tracking visitor behavior can be done through Google Analytics. We plan to complete this in the spring.
 * URL: [Viewing performance reports](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/7). We have not completed this, however, like the previous issue, performance reports can be viewed through Google Analytics, which is compatible with Wix. We plan to complete this in the spring.

The reason we were unable to finish these issues is due to us focusing on three features, and design mostly in sprint 2. Speaking to our mentor and professor, we were told to start working with website analytics in the Spring. We "technically" were unable to finish "Update website information" because that going to be a year long process, we will continuously work on this.

## Code Files for Review
None as of right now.
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to create designs that our client reviewed and gave us feedback on.
  * We were able to learn more about how to use components within the the Wix interface
  * We learned how to use figma and adobe illustrator to create prototypes
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * We would like to meet with our client more to continuously refine the features on the website.
   * We want a better understanding on some plugins that can be used for website development.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Creating some sort of client portal through Wix so our client is able to keep track of her clients.
   * Finish creating the main pages that our client wants.
   * Continue refining features on our website.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * URL: [Manage client information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/9). We have not completed this issue, however, we will most likely use a third-party application to complete this issue.
 * URL: [Update website information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/8). We have not completed this, however, website changes and updates can be made through the Wix manager page.
 * URL: [Tracking visitor behavior](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/6). We have not completed this since we want to confirm with our client of what she wants to do. Wix provides insights and analytics that is currently implemented, however, we want to ask if our client wants to use Google Analytics or keep this built-in Wix service.
 * URL: [Viewing performance reports](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/7). We have not completed this, however, like the previous issue, performance reports can be viewed through Google Analytics, which is compatible with Wix.
 * URL: [Automate lecture slide decks](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/27). We have not completed this due to sprint 4 focusing on research.
 * URL: [Research how to automate transcript for meeting notes](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/26).
 * URL: [Automate marketing emails](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/24). We have not finished this because we focused on research, however, Wix has a built-in automation system that allows for automated marketing emails to be sent to Wix contacts.
 * URL: [Managing tasks and calendar events](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/25). We have not completed this because we focused on research, however, Wix provides a built-in calendar and event traacking system that syncs with your personal calendar (Outlook, google)

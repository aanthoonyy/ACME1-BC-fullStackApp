 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * URL: [Manage client information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/9). We have not completed this issue, however, we will most likely use a third-party application to complete this issue.
 * URL: [Update website information](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/8). We have not completed this, however, website changes and updates can be made through the Wix manager page.
 * URL: [Tracking visitor behavior](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/6). We have not completed this, however, tracking visitor behavior can be done through Google Analytics.
 * URL: [Viewing performance reports](https://github.com/aanthoonyy/ACME1-BC-fullStackApp/issues/7). We have not completed this, however, like the previous issue, performance reports can be viewed through Google Analytics, which is compatible with Wix.
